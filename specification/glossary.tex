\newglossaryentry{pipeline}{
name={pipeline},
description={Representation of a particular series of actions to be executed against some input data in order to produce a desired output. Individual \glspl{step} in a pipeline may depend on other steps. A pipeline as a whole can be envisioned as a directed graph, usually without cycles}
}

\newglossaryentry{workflow}{
name={workflow},
description={See \gls{pipeline}}
} 

\newglossaryentry{step}{
name={step},
description={An individual `block' in a pipeline. It may be either a \gls{primitive step} or a \gls{composite step}}
}

\newglossaryentry{primitive step}{
name={primitive step},
description={An indivisible step - e.g. a step which does not contain substeps. A primitive step is suitable for passing to a \gls{job executor} for execution on a particular host}
}

\newglossaryentry{composite step}{
name={composite step},
description={A step made up of other steps. A composite step can be thought of as a \gls{pipeline} in its own right, included as part of a larger pipeline}
}

\newglossaryentry{job executor}{
name={job executor},
description={Takes an abstract description of some code to be run in the form of a \gls{primitive step} and executes it as a \gls{job} on a particular host}
}

\newglossaryentry{job}{
name={job},
description={A specific piece of code executing on a host}
}

\newglossaryentry{metadata}{
name={metadata},
plural={metadata},
description={Data passed into or generated during execution of a pipeline which is used by the Mercury system itself, rather than simply within the pipeline. Examples include checksums, host execution details, or resource usage data}
}

\newglossaryentry{abstract pipeline}{
name={abstract pipeline},
description={A high level representation of a pipeline with free inputs and outputs}
}

\newglossaryentry{configured pipeline}{
name={configured pipeline},
description={A high level representation of a pipeline with all inputs and outputs bound}
}

\newglossaryentry{executable pipeline}{
name={executable pipeline},
description={A low-level pipeline corresponding to the actual series of steps to be executed}
}

\newglossaryentry{checkpoint}{
name={checkpoint},
description={A checkpointing system allows for currently running jobs to be suspended to disk (by serialising the contents of memory, the state of file handles and system resources etc) and resumed later, potentially from a different host}
